Anomaly Detection in IoT Signals

Description

This project focuses on detecting anomalies in IoT signals using machine learning techniques. By simulating complex IoT signals with dominant frequencies and noise, we analyze the data using Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT) and perform anomaly detection using Isolation Forest. Root cause analysis is conducted using DBSCAN clustering.

Installation

To install and set up the project dependencies, follow these steps:

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/anomaly-detection-iot.git
cd anomaly-detection-iot
Create a virtual environment:

python -m venv env
source env/bin/activate  # On Windows use `env\Scripts\activate`
Install the required dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
To use the project, follow these instructions:

Ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed (see Installation).
Run the main script to perform anomaly detection:
python scripts/anomaly_detection.py
Explore the results and visualizations generated by the script.
Data
The data used in this project is simulated complex IoT signals with multiple frequencies and added noise. The dataset is generated within the script itself and does not require any external data files.
